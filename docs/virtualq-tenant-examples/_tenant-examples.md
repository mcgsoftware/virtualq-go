# Tenant Examples
This section is to give some details and insights on how VirtualQ will be used by our initial tenants. 

There are 2 tenants initially:

- `starbucks-order-status-case-study.md` - an 'order status' screen on the wall, which tells customers waiting for their drinks and food where their order is in the barista processing queue. 

- `DMV-virtual-lines.md` - This is for handling lines at a DMV where people are waiting for employees at a desk to handle citizens needing DMV services. 

The content of these tenant example files isn't a full solution, but an explanation of the problem and solution that may work for them. 

It is a goal at the end of first release to demo both tenants and how VirtualQ was used to address their use cases as a solution. This will also be part of our QA effort for testing and verifying the product.
